My name is Temitope Elizabeth Sorinola.
I am a seasoned Data Analyst and a Software Developer who enjoys motivating people, coding, learning, singing,cooking, cleaning, dancing
and playing musical instruments. I had my BSc honours degrees in Computing at the University of Kent, Medway. As much as I love to learn new things, I also love to impact knowledge into other people.
